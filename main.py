# Variable Assignment - Modify
#modify a code to add more variables and output them, which store strings

#You can combine variables with strings in an output

name1 = "Axl"
name2 = "Slash"
#Add 2 more variables to store 'Duff' and 'Izzy'
name3 = "Duff" #create variable called name3 to store string "Duff"
name4 = "Izzy" #create variable called name4 to store string "Izzy"

#This line uses concatenation to join the variables together with the string 'and' to make a sentence.

#Complete the line to output all of the variables 
print(name1 + " and " + name2 + " and " + name3 + " and " + name4 + ".")
#use + signs to concatenate all strings and variables together to form one sentence to be outputted.
