## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- print does not have a capital letter
- The string text is surrounded with speech marks
- The string (including speech marks) is surrounded by brackets.
- Variable goes on the left, data on the right for assignment.
- You've used a '+' between each string and variable that need concatenating.
